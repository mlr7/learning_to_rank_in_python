# learning_to_rank_in_python
An exploration of learning-to-rank machine learning approaches in Python

### Introduction

Learning to Rank (LTR) algorithms are an interesting and useful sub-branch of machine learning. In this notebook we are going to explore several of these algorithms and have some fun with an open source ranking benchmark dataset.

### Techniques

##### Pointwise LTR Methods
###### Classification
###### Regression

##### Pairwise LTR Methods
###### RankNet
###### LambdaRank

##### Listwise LTR Methods
###### LambdaMART

### Scoring Metric

##### NDCG: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain

### Dataset

MSLR-WEB10K: Open source, 10,000 queries, relevance values from 0 to 4, schema: relevance, query id, feature vector
